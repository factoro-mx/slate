# Introduction

Welcome to the Factoro API - Buyers documentation. You can use our API to access our endpoints and integrate your operation directly with us.

We have language bindings in Shell, Ruby, Python, and JavaScript! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

# About this API

There are some thing you should know about Factoro's API.

All operations are calculated with a precision of 6 decimals, and transformed into a `Float` when the information leaves the server.
Due to the fallbacks of using `Float`, Factoro calculates operations using Big Decimal, to ensure idempotence and precision.

Some actions of this API trigger notifications. This means that some (or all) of the related characters
in each instruction will receive and email with the corresponding information.
Each action that does, will have it in the description.

We broke down information result into Models, to maintain a simpler and cleaner looking documentation. You can see our models <a class="link" href="#models">here</a>.

# Sandbox

The endpoints are the same in both Sandbox and Production environments. The only thing that changes is the base URI.

To use the API in Sandbox mode, replace the base url with `https://sandbox-api.factoro.mx`.

# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "<%= config[:url] %>/v1" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${secret_key}" -H "X-API-KEY: ${api_key}"
```

> Make sure to replace `token` with your API key.

Factoro uses a combination of API keys to access the API.

You will receive an **API** **Key** and a **Secret** **Key**, both of which should accompany all your requests.

| Header        | Content              |
| ------------- | -------------------- |
| Authorization | Bearer ${secret_key} |
| X-API-KEY     | ${api_key}           |

`Authorization: Bearer ${secret_key}`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>${secret_key}</code> with your personal secret key and <code>${api_key}</code> with your api key.
</aside>

<aside class="warning">
Never share your API keys with anyone. If you believe your keys are compromised, contact the Factoro support team immediately.

# Verification

## Verify that your integration and API key is working

```shell
curl "<%= config[:url] %>/v1/shared/authentication/hello" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${secret_key}" -H "X-API-KEY: ${api_key}"
```

> Response:

```json
{
  "message": "Hello Factoro",
  "time": "2021-08-26T12:00:00"
}
```

This endpoint helps the user verify that the integration is correctly implemented.
By calling this endpoint, you will have tested that your service is correctly attaching the API key
and calling our server.
